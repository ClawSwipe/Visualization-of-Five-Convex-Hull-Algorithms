# Visualization of Convex Hull Algorithms - Brute Force, Jarvis March, Graham Scan, Quick Elimination and Monotone Chain
The objective of this project is to illustrate the development of five convex algorithms using a set of user-inputted points. Additionally, three line intersection algorithms are implemented to determine whether two user-defined lines intersect. Detailed instructions can be found on the project website.
